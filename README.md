# Skyward Pokemon Challenge
The project uses most of the new Android technologies and architecture components including, **but not limited to**, MVVM (with `ViewModel` and `LiveData`), Hilt DI, Kotlin Coroutines, Retrofit/Okhttp, and other standard design patterns. A list of Pokemon cards (fetched from the [API](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/api-reference/cards/search-cards)) are initially displayed in a grid UI with each being tappable to take the user to another screen to view the selected card in more detail (via another [call](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/api-reference/cards/get-card)).
